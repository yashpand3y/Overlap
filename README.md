# Overlap
A stacking game created from scratch in Turbo C++ using native graphic libraries

## How to run
### STEP 1: Install Turbo C++
Please follow the steps referenced here: https://www.javatpoint.com/cpp-installation

### STEP 2: Download the .cpp file in this repository

### STEP 3: Ensure reference to BGI is correct
After installing TurboC++, ensure the path in `LINE 25: initgraph(&gd,&gm,"C:\\TurboC3\\BGI");` of the program references the `BGI` directory correctly.
If you installed TurboC++ onto your `C Drive` directly, the paths would be approximately correct
Without it, some of the text and formatting will be incorrect but the game will still run.

### STEP 4: Run the program
